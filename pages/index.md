The establishment of the **Clarence Fitzroy Bryant College** was a pivotal post-independence project of the [Federation of St. Kitts](https://www.stkittstourism.kn/) and [Nevis](https://nevisisland.com/). The Federation gained independence from Britain in 1983 and the College was established in 1988 as the College of Further Education. The government of the day intended that the College would provide the skilled workforce needed for the developing country (which is the smallest independent nation in the Western Hemisphere) for economic development. Policy makers envisaged an institution that would provide training for middle managers, build human resource expertise in different sectors of the economy, and offer first year university courses in collaboration with the University of the West Indies.

The College of Further Education (as it was then known) brought the separate institutions of the Technical College, the Teacherâ€™s College, and the School of Nursing (now Health Sciences) under one administration. Later the traditional Sixth Form College was brought under its purview. In 1988 these schools were all at separate locations and served a cumulative 150 students. In 1996 the institution was renamed the Clarence Fitzroy Bryant College. The new name honored Clarence Fitzroy Bryant, a former political leader who introduced universal access to secondary education to the Federation, as part as a broader vision by earlier political leaders like Joseph N. France to provide public education up to the tertiary level.

Currently the CFBCC has five divisions (1) *Arts, Sciences & General Studies*, (2) *Technical and Vocational, Education & Management Studies*, (3) *Health Sciences*, (4) *Teacher Education*, and (5) *Adult & Continuing Education*, offering 60 degree programs.
