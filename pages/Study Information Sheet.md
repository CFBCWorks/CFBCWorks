##### BUILDING A TRUSTED DIGITAL HISTORY OF THE CLARENCE FITZROY BRYANT COLLEGE
The the Archiving, Documenting & Disseminating the History of The Clarence Fitzroy Bryant College (CFBC) Project has identified that  
1. there is no systematic documentation of the history of the establishment or impact of the CFBC.  
2. the risk that this history could be lost is high, as the policymakers and others involved are of advanced age or deceased.  
3. it is therefore urgent that we research, document and preserve this history before it is lost. 

As part of the research process the project team is conducting interviews, and digitizing artifacts including but not limited to physical memorabilia, photographs, and documents to record memories and personal commentaries of historical significance to the CFBC. 

The recordings and digitized artifacts we make in this project are intended to be part of the historical record of The Clarence Fitzroy Bryant College. They will be stored indefinitely at The Clarence Fitzroy Bryant College (or any successor institution). They will not be used for commercial purposes.
